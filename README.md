## SecLan Security DSL and Check Repository
Developing secure software systems is challenging. Considering security not only at the end, but already early on in the development process has become a widely accepted best practice. Still, vulnerabilities are commonly introduced by developers in code and need to be discovered by manual code reviews or automated static code analyzers. In fact, the automated detection of vulnerabilities is a major area of research. However, estimating the impact of a detected vulnerability requires reasoning about the design of the system. Specifically, due to the gap in abstraction, tracing the results of a static analyzer to the design is a challenging and error-prone task that relies mostly on the developer. We present the SecLan to address this challenge by relating security DSLs to static code analyzers that perform security checks by mapping each others' concepts. SecLan uses several conceptual models for this endeavor.
